# RehabAI SEO Strategy — Lower Back Pain

*Created: 2026-02-20*

## Executive Summary

Lower back pain SEO is **extremely competitive**. Major health publishers (Healthline, WebMD, Spine-Health, Mayo Clinic) dominate head terms with Domain Authority 80+. 

**Our angle:** We're not competing on "what is lower back pain" — we're targeting **actionable, program-focused long-tail keywords** where big publishers don't compete because they can't deliver actual programs.

## Market Size

- **"lower back pain"** — ~1.5M monthly searches (US)
- **"lower back pain exercises"** — ~200K monthly searches
- **"lower back pain relief"** — ~150K monthly searches
- **"lower back pain stretches"** — ~100K monthly searches

**80% of Americans** experience lower back pain at some point. This is a massive, evergreen market.

## Unique Angles (Our Moat)

1. **AI-generated programs** — No other back pain site offers personalized, AI-built rehab programs. Every article can CTA to "Get your custom program."

2. **Progressive structure** — We're not just listing exercises. We're teaching progression, periodization, and recovery timelines.

3. **Interactive over static** — Our exercises will have video, timers, and tracking. Articles drive to the app experience.

4. **Condition-specific depth** — We can go deeper on specific conditions because the AI can generate infinite variations.

## Questions for Jordan

1. **Domain:** Are we using rehabai.com or a different domain?
2. **Brand name:** "RehabAI" or something else for the blog author/brand?
3. **Email capture:** Should we build an email list? (Recommended)
4. **Budget for tools:** Any budget for Ahrefs/Semrush for keyword research? (Free alternatives exist)
