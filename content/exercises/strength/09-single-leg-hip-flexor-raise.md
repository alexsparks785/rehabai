# Single-Leg Hip Flexor Raise

## Overview
The single-leg hip flexor raise strengthens the hip flexors (primarily the psoas and iliacus) through their full range of motion. Using parallettes or a raised surface, you'll lift your leg while maintaining a stable core — building the strength needed for walking, running, and everyday movement.

## Why It Matters
Weak hip flexors are as problematic as tight hip flexors. When your hip flexors can't do their job, your lower back compensates by hyperextending. This exercise builds hip flexor strength through range, teaching them to work properly.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Psoas major, iliacus (hip flexors)
- **Secondary:** Rectus femoris (quad), transverse abdominis (core)

## Equipment
- Parallettes or dip bars
- Or: raised surface you can support yourself on
- Or: floor (regression)

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: Seated Knee Raise (Floor)

**Setup:**
1. Sit on floor with legs extended
2. Hands on floor beside hips
3. Lean back slightly, lift one leg

**Execution:**
1. Keeping leg straight, lift it as high as possible
2. Hold for 2-3 seconds
3. Lower with control
4. Repeat all reps, then switch legs

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 10-12 reps per leg
- Focus on hip flexor engagement, not momentum

---

### Level 2: L-Sit Tuck (Parallettes)

**Setup:**
1. Support yourself on parallettes, arms straight
2. Shoulders down and back
3. Start with legs hanging

**Execution:**
1. Tuck knees toward chest
2. Hold tucked position 5-10 seconds
3. Lower with control
4. Repeat

**Protocol:**
- 3-5 sets of 5-10 second holds
- Build toward 30-second hold

---

### Level 3: Single-Leg Raise (Parallettes)

**Setup:**
1. Support yourself on parallettes
2. One leg extended forward, one tucked or hanging

**Execution:**
1. With straight leg, lift as high as hip flexibility allows
2. Hold at top for 2-3 seconds
3. Lower with control
4. Repeat all reps, then switch

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 6-8 reps per leg
- This is challenging — don't rush progression

---

### Level 4: Full L-Sit

**Setup:**
1. Support on parallettes
2. Both legs extended forward

**Execution:**
1. Lift both legs until parallel to ground (L position)
2. Hold for time
3. Lower with control

**Protocol:**
- Work toward 30-60 second holds
- This takes months of consistent practice

---

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Keep shoulders pulled DOWN (don't shrug)
- Brace core — tighten transverse abdominis
- Lift from the hip, not by swinging
- Point or flex toes consistently
- Breathe steadily throughout holds

**Don't:**
- Shrug shoulders up toward ears
- Use momentum to swing legs up
- Hold breath during long holds
- Let lower back round
- Rush through reps

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Shoulders shrugging | Push down through arms, depress shoulders |
| Using momentum | Slow down — controlled lift only |
| Can't hold L-sit | Regress to tuck position |
| Lower back rounding | Tilt pelvis slightly forward |
| Arms bending | Lock arms, push parallettes into ground |

---

## Scaling Options

### Easier:
- Floor-based knee raises
- Tucked holds instead of straight leg
- Shorter hold times (5 seconds)
- Use dip station for more clearance

### Harder:
- Full L-sit hold
- V-sit (legs raised above horizontal)
- Single-leg raises from L-sit position
- Weighted ankle cuffs (advanced)

## Why Hip Flexor STRENGTH Matters

Everyone talks about hip flexor stretching. But weak hip flexors are equally problematic:

- Can't lift legs properly during walking/running
- Lower back compensates to initiate hip flexion
- Poor posture when sitting (pelvis tilts back)
- Decreased athletic performance

Balance is key: stretch when tight, strengthen when weak. Most people need both.

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 2-3x per week
**When:** Core portion of workout, or as accessory work
**Pairing:** Works well with hip flexor stretches (couch stretch)

**Progression timeline:**
- Level 1: Week 1-4
- Level 2: Week 4-8
- Level 3: Week 8-12+
- Level 4: Months of consistent practice
