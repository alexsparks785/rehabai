# Trap-3 Raise (Prone Y-Raise)

## Overview
The Trap-3 raise, also called the prone Y-raise, strengthens the lower trapezius muscle — the portion of the trap that pulls your shoulder blades down and back. This is critical for posture, shoulder health, and reducing upper back compensation patterns.

## Why It Matters
Most people have overactive upper traps and weak lower traps. This creates elevated, forward-rounded shoulders that increase thoracic kyphosis (hunched upper back). When the upper back is stuck in flexion, the lower back compensates by hyperextending. Fixing the lower traps fixes posture upstream.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Lower trapezius (trap 3)
- **Secondary:** Middle trapezius, rhomboids, posterior deltoid

## Equipment
- Incline bench (30-45 degrees)
- Light dumbbells (2-10 lbs to start)

---

## Execution

### Setup
1. Set bench to 30-45 degree incline
2. Lie face-down on bench (chest supported)
3. Hold light dumbbells, arms hanging straight down
4. Palms facing each other (neutral grip) or thumbs up

### The Movement
1. **Raise:** Lift arms in a "Y" pattern (45-degree angle from body)
2. **Squeeze:** At top, squeeze shoulder blades down and together
3. **Hold:** Pause 1-2 seconds at top
4. **Lower:** Slowly return to start (3 seconds down)
5. **Repeat**

### Protocol
- 3 sets x 12-15 reps
- Tempo: 2 seconds up, 2 seconds hold, 3 seconds down
- Rest: 45-60 seconds between sets

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: Floor Y-Raise (No Weight)

**Setup:**
1. Lie face-down on floor
2. Arms extended overhead in Y position
3. Thumbs pointing up

**Execution:**
1. Lift arms off floor (small movement)
2. Squeeze lower traps
3. Hold 3-5 seconds
4. Lower with control

**Protocol:**
- 3 x 10-12 reps (or 10-second holds)
- Focus on feeling the lower trap engage

---

### Level 2: Incline Bench, No Weight

**Setup:**
1. Lie face-down on incline bench
2. Arms hanging, thumbs up

**Execution:**
1. Raise arms in Y pattern
2. Full range of motion
3. Squeeze and hold

**Protocol:**
- 3 x 12-15 reps
- Master this before adding weight

---

### Level 3: Incline Bench, Light Weight

**Setup:**
- Same as Level 2
- Light dumbbells (2-5 lbs)

**Protocol:**
- 3 x 12-15 reps
- DO NOT go heavy — this is an activation exercise

---

### Level 4: Incline Bench, Moderate Weight

**Setup:**
- Same position
- 5-10 lb dumbbells

**Protocol:**
- 3 x 10-12 reps
- This is typically the endpoint — don't chase heavy weights

---

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Lead with thumbs (thumbs pointing up or toward ceiling)
- Raise arms at 45-degree angle (Y shape)
- Pull shoulder blades DOWN toward back pockets
- Control the entire movement
- Feel the muscle working between shoulder blades and mid-back

**Don't:**
- Shrug shoulders UP (this activates upper trap, not lower)
- Go heavy — this defeats the purpose
- Rush through reps
- Use momentum
- Let arms drift to the sides (T shape) or straight forward (I shape)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Using upper traps | Focus on pulling shoulder blades DOWN |
| Going too heavy | Use 2-5 lbs — lighter than you think |
| Arms too wide (T shape) | Keep 45-degree angle (Y shape) |
| Arms too forward (I shape) | Wider angle, about 45 degrees |
| No pause at top | Hold 1-2 seconds, squeeze |
| Rushing | Slow down — 3 second lowering |

## The Trap Anatomy

Your trapezius has three functional portions:

1. **Upper trap (Trap 1):** Elevates shoulders (shrug motion) — usually OVERACTIVE
2. **Middle trap (Trap 2):** Retracts shoulder blades (squeeze together) — often weak
3. **Lower trap (Trap 3):** Depresses and retracts shoulder blades (down and back) — usually VERY weak

The Y-raise specifically targets Trap 3, which is why it's called the "Trap-3 Raise."

## Why Lower Trap Strength Matters

Weak lower traps lead to:
- Elevated, forward shoulders
- Increased upper trap tension (tight upper traps)
- Thoracic kyphosis (hunched upper back)
- Compensatory lumbar hyperextension
- Shoulder impingement risk

Strong lower traps:
- Pull shoulders down and back
- Create better posture
- Reduce upper trap tension
- Allow thoracic spine to extend properly
- Reduce lower back compensation

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 2-3x per week
**When:** Part of warm-up, or shoulder/back accessory work
**Pairing:** Works well with face pulls and external rotations

**Key Point:** This is a corrective exercise, not a strength builder. Never prioritize weight over form and muscle engagement.
