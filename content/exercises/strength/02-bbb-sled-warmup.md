# BBB Sled Warm-Up

## Overview
The sled push is the perfect warm-up for lower back rehab: it loads the legs and core without any spinal compression or eccentric stress. "BBB" stands for "Blood, Balance, and Build" — this movement gets blood flowing, warms up the movement patterns, and builds work capacity without beating you up.

## Why It Matters
Most lower back issues are aggravated by exercises with heavy eccentric (lowering) phases. The sled has ZERO eccentric load — you're only pushing, never absorbing force. This makes it ideal for warming up before strength work or as standalone conditioning.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Quadriceps, glutes, calves
- **Secondary:** Core (anti-extension), hip flexors, shoulders

## Equipment
- Prowler sled or push sled
- Weight plates
- 20-40 yard runway

## Execution

### Setup
1. Load sled with light weight (start with just the sled)
2. Grip the high handles (upright position) or low handles (45-degree lean)
3. Position feet shoulder-width apart

### The Push
1. Drive through the balls of your feet
2. Keep core braced — don't let lower back arch
3. Take short, quick steps
4. Keep head neutral — don't look up or down
5. Push for 20-40 yards, then rest

## Warm-Up Protocol

**Duration:** 5-8 minutes

| Round | Distance | Rest | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | 20 yards | Walk back | Empty sled, slow pace |
| 2 | 20 yards | Walk back | Empty sled, moderate pace |
| 3 | 30 yards | Walk back | Add 25-45 lbs |
| 4 | 30 yards | Walk back | Same weight, faster pace |
| 5 | 40 yards | Done | Optional: add more weight |

**Key:** This is a WARM-UP, not a workout. You should feel warm and loose, not exhausted.

## Conditioning Protocol (Optional)

If using the sled for conditioning rather than just warm-up:

**Light Day:**
- 6-8 x 40 yards
- Rest: walk back slowly
- Weight: 50-100 lbs

**Heavy Day:**
- 4-6 x 20 yards
- Rest: 90 seconds
- Weight: 100-200+ lbs

## Form Cues

### High Handle Position (Easier)
- More upright torso
- Less hip flexion demand
- Better for beginners or those with hip issues

### Low Handle Position (Harder)
- 45-degree forward lean
- More glute and hip flexor engagement
- Greater core demand

**Cues for Both:**
- "Drive the ground away"
- "Chest up, hips forward"
- "Short, choppy steps — not long strides"
- "Breathe continuously — don't hold breath"

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Overstriding | Take shorter, quicker steps |
| Looking up | Keep neck neutral, eyes forward |
| Arching lower back | Brace core before each push |
| Going too heavy | Start light — it's a warm-up |
| Leaning too far forward | Keep weight over mid-foot |

## Scaling Options

### No Sled Available?
Substitute with:
- **Farmer carries** (2 dumbbells, walk 40 yards)
- **Wall push** (push against wall for 30 seconds, drive legs)
- **Marching in place** with high knees (2-3 minutes)

### Too Easy?
- Add weight
- Use low handles
- Increase distance
- Decrease rest time

### Too Hard?
- Remove all weight (empty sled)
- Use high handles
- Shorter distances (10-15 yards)
- Longer rest (60-90 seconds)

## Programming Notes

**When to use:** Beginning of every strength session
**Frequency:** Every training day
**Purpose:** Warm-up, blood flow, movement prep — NOT fatigue

If you finish the sled warm-up feeling tired, you went too hard. Dial it back.
