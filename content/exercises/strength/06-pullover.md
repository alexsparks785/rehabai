# Pullover

## Overview
The pullover is a classic exercise that stretches the lats and chest while strengthening the serratus anterior and core. When performed from a hip bridge position, it also engages the glutes and teaches full-body tension — essential for spinal stability.

## Why It Matters
Tight lats pull the shoulders forward and increase thoracic kyphosis (rounded upper back). This forces the lumbar spine to hyperextend to compensate. The pullover stretches the lats while strengthening the muscles that keep your shoulders and thorax in good position.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Latissimus dorsi (stretched), serratus anterior, chest
- **Secondary:** Glutes (in bridge position), core, triceps

## Equipment
- Dumbbell
- Flat bench (perpendicular positioning)

## Hip Bridge Pullover

### Setup
1. Sit perpendicular to bench
2. Slide down so upper back/shoulders rest on bench
3. Feet flat on floor, hip-width apart
4. Drive hips up into bridge position (straight line from knees to shoulders)
5. Hold single dumbbell with both hands, arms extended over chest

### Execution
1. **Lower:** With slightly bent elbows, lower dumbbell behind head (2-3 seconds)
2. **Stretch:** Feel the stretch in lats and chest at bottom
3. **Pause:** Brief pause at stretched position
4. **Pull:** Return dumbbell to starting position over chest
5. **Maintain:** Keep hips up throughout — glutes stay engaged

### Protocol
- 3 sets x 10-12 reps
- Tempo: 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 2 seconds up
- Rest: 60-90 seconds between sets

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: Floor Pullover (No Bridge)
- Lie flat on floor
- Perform pullover movement only
- Focus on lat stretch and control
- 3 x 12-15 reps with light weight

### Level 2: Bench Pullover (No Bridge)
- Lie flat on bench lengthwise
- Greater range of motion than floor
- 3 x 10-12 reps

### Level 3: Hip Bridge Pullover (Standard)
- Perpendicular to bench, hips bridged
- Adds glute and core engagement
- 3 x 10-12 reps

### Level 4: Single-Arm Pullover
- Same position, one dumbbell in one hand
- Anti-rotation challenge for core
- 3 x 8-10 reps per arm

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Keep hips HIGH throughout (squeeze glutes)
- Maintain slight bend in elbows (don't lock out)
- Lower dumbbell until you feel lat stretch
- Control the weight — no momentum
- Breathe: inhale as you lower, exhale as you pull

**Don't:**
- Let hips drop during the movement
- Arch lower back excessively
- Bend elbows too much (becomes tricep exercise)
- Go too heavy — this is a stretch-focused movement
- Rush the eccentric (lowering) phase

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Hips dropping | Squeeze glutes harder, use lighter weight |
| Lower back arching | Tuck pelvis slightly, brace core |
| Elbows bending too much | Lock elbow angle and move from shoulders |
| Going too heavy | Start with 15-20 lbs, progress slowly |
| Not feeling lat stretch | Lower the weight further behind head |

## Range of Motion Notes

The goal is to feel a deep stretch in your lats at the bottom position. How far you can lower the weight depends on your shoulder mobility:

- **Limited mobility:** Stop when you feel moderate stretch (no pain)
- **Good mobility:** Lower until upper arms are roughly in line with torso
- **Excellent mobility:** Can go slightly past torso line

Never force the stretch. Mobility will improve over time.

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 2x per week
**When:** After main pressing movements, or as standalone accessory
**Pairing:** Works well with rows and face pulls

**Progression:**
1. Master form with light weight (15-20 lbs)
2. Add weight in 5 lb increments
3. Progress to single-arm variation for anti-rotation challenge
