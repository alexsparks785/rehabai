# Tibialis Raise

## Overview
The tibialis raise strengthens the tibialis anterior — the muscle on the front of your shin. This is the antagonist to the calf muscles and is critical for ankle stability, knee health, and pain-free walking/running.

## Why It Matters
When your tibialis is weak relative to your calves, ankle mechanics suffer. This creates a cascade up the chain: poor ankle → knee compensation → hip compensation → lower back pain. Training the tibialis restores balance to the lower leg.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Tibialis anterior
- **Secondary:** Extensor digitorum longus, extensor hallucis longus

## Equipment
- Wall or sturdy object for support
- Or: Tib Bar (specialized equipment)
- Or: Resistance band

## Wall Tibialis Raise (Standard)

### Setup
1. Lean back against a wall
2. Walk feet forward 12-18 inches from wall
3. Keep back flat against wall
4. Arms relaxed at sides or crossed

### Execution
1. Lift toes off ground (dorsiflex ankles)
2. Pull toes toward shins as far as possible
3. Hold at top for 1-2 seconds
4. Lower slowly (2-3 seconds)
5. Light tap on ground, immediately repeat

### Protocol
- 3 sets x 15-25 reps
- Tempo: 2 seconds up, 2 seconds hold, 3 seconds down
- Rest: 60 seconds between sets

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: Wall Tib Raise (Heels Down)

**Setup:**
- Lean on wall, feet 12 inches out
- Heels stay on ground throughout

**Protocol:**
- 3 x 20-25 reps
- Build endurance in the tibialis

---

### Level 2: Elevated Heels

**Setup:**
- Place heels on small elevation (1-2 inch plate)
- Back against wall
- Increased range of motion

**Protocol:**
- 3 x 15-20 reps
- Greater stretch at bottom position

---

### Level 3: Banded Tibialis Raise

**Setup:**
- Sit on floor or bench
- Loop resistance band around toes, anchored behind you
- Tension pulling toes away from shins

**Execution:**
- Pull toes toward shins against band resistance
- Hold 1-2 seconds, release slowly

**Protocol:**
- 3 x 12-15 reps
- Adjust band tension as needed

---

### Level 4: Tib Bar (Advanced)

**Setup:**
- Specialized Tib Bar equipment
- Sit on bench, heels on ground
- Bar loaded across toes/forefoot

**Execution:**
- Lift toes toward shins against weight
- Full range of motion
- Control the descent

**Protocol:**
- 3 x 10-15 reps
- Start very light (5-10 lbs on bar)

---

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Pull toes toward shins (not just lifting off ground)
- Control the lowering phase (eccentric)
- Keep knees relatively straight
- Maintain contact with wall (wall version)
- Full range of motion — all the way up

**Don't:**
- Rush through reps
- Bounce at the bottom
- Let knees bend excessively
- Skip the pause at top
- Ignore the lowering phase

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Not enough range | Pull toes higher toward shins |
| Bouncing | Pause at bottom, controlled lift |
| Knees bending | Keep legs relatively straight |
| Going too fast | Slow down — 2-3 second tempo |
| Standing too close to wall | Walk feet further out |

## Why Tibialis Training Matters

The tibialis anterior does two jobs:
1. **Dorsiflexion:** Lifting the foot during walking/running (swing phase)
2. **Eccentric braking:** Controlling the foot as it lands

Weak tibialis = shin splints, ankle sprains, and compensation patterns up the chain.

### The KOT Connection
"Knees Over Toes" training popularized tibialis work because:
- It balances the lower leg (tib + calf together)
- It improves ankle dorsiflexion range
- It reduces knee stress by improving ankle mechanics
- It fixes the foundation before working up the chain

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 3-4x per week (tibialis recovers fast)
**When:** Before or after calf work, or as standalone
**Volume:** High reps (15-25) for endurance; lower reps (8-12) with resistance for strength

**Pairing:** Always pair with calf raises for balanced lower leg development

**Progression:**
1. Wall raises → 
2. Elevated heels → 
3. Banded → 
4. Tib Bar (if available)
