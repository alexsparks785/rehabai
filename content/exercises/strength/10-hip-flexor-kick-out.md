# Hip Flexor Kick Out

## Overview
The hip flexor kick out is a standing single-leg hip flexion exercise that builds strength in the psoas and iliacus while challenging balance. You'll kick your leg forward and hold it, training the hip flexors to work through their full range against gravity.

## Why It Matters
Weak hip flexors can't properly lift your leg during walking and running, forcing your lower back to compensate. This exercise builds the end-range hip flexor strength needed for pain-free movement.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Psoas major, iliacus (hip flexors)
- **Secondary:** Rectus femoris (quad), core (balance)

## Equipment
- None required
- Wall or chair for balance (optional)

## Execution

### Setup
1. Stand tall on one leg
2. Light touch on wall if needed for balance
3. Standing leg slightly bent (not locked)

### The Movement
1. Kick opposite leg forward and UP
2. Keep leg straight
3. Lift as high as possible while keeping torso upright
4. HOLD at top for 5 seconds
5. Lower with control
6. Repeat for all reps, then switch legs

## Protocol

**Sets:** 2
**Reps:** 5 each leg
**Hold:** 5 seconds at top of each rep

**Rest:** 30-60 seconds between legs

---

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Stand tall — don't lean back
- Keep lifted leg straight (slight bend is okay)
- Hold the top position for full 5 seconds
- Control the descent — don't just drop
- Squeeze hip flexor hard at top

**Don't:**
- Lean back to lift leg higher
- Bend the knee of lifted leg
- Rush through the hold
- Let standing knee lock out
- Use momentum to swing leg up

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: With Support
- Hold wall or chair for balance
- Focus on hip flexor engagement
- 2 x 5 reps, 3-second holds

### Level 2: Freestanding
- No support
- Balance challenges core
- 2 x 5 reps, 5-second holds

### Level 3: Extended Hold
- 2 x 5 reps, 8-10 second holds
- Increased time under tension

### Level 4: Ankle Weights
- Add light ankle weight (2-5 lbs)
- 2 x 5 reps, 5-second holds
- Builds serious hip flexor strength

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Leaning back | Stand tall, slight forward lean is better |
| Bending lifted leg | Keep it straight or nearly straight |
| Rushing holds | Full 5 seconds — count slowly |
| Swinging leg up | Controlled lift, no momentum |
| Holding breath | Breathe throughout the hold |

## Why "Kick Out" Works

Most hip flexor exercises are done lying down or seated. The kick out is different:

1. **Gravity is the resistance** — no equipment needed
2. **Balance demand** — core works hard to stabilize
3. **End-range strength** — you hold at the hardest position
4. **Carryover to walking** — directly mimics leg swing

If you can hold a strong kick out with no support, your hip flexors are working properly.

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 2-3x per week
**When:** Near end of strength routine (position #10)
**Pairing:** Works well after split squats which stretch the opposite hip flexor
