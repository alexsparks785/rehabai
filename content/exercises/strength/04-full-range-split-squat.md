# Full Range Split Squat

## Overview
The full range split squat is a unilateral lower body exercise that builds leg strength while stretching the hip flexors of the back leg. For lower back rehab, this is critical: tight hip flexors pull the pelvis forward and create excessive lumbar lordosis — a common pain generator.

## Why It Matters
This exercise does double duty: strengthening the quads and glutes while simultaneously lengthening the hip flexors. Most people with lower back pain have shortened hip flexors from sitting. This fixes that.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Quadriceps, glutes
- **Secondary:** Hip flexors (stretched), hamstrings, core

## Equipment
- Bench or elevated surface (for rear foot)
- Dumbbells (optional)
- Aerobic steps for front foot elevation (advanced)

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: Bodyweight Split Squat (Floor)
**Setup:**
1. Stand in split stance — one foot forward, one back
2. Feet hip-width apart for balance (not on a tightrope)
3. Back heel elevated (on ball of foot)

**Execution:**
1. Lower straight down until back knee nearly touches floor
2. Keep torso upright — don't lean forward
3. Drive through front foot to stand
4. All reps on one side, then switch

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 10-12 reps per leg
- Rest 60 seconds between legs

### Level 2: Rear Foot Elevated (Bulgarian)
**Setup:**
1. Place back foot on bench behind you (shoelaces down)
2. Hop forward until front shin is vertical at bottom position
3. Front foot flat on ground

**Execution:**
1. Lower until back knee nearly touches floor
2. Front knee tracks over toes (some forward travel is fine)
3. Drive through front heel to stand

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 8-10 reps per leg
- Bodyweight first, then add dumbbells

---

### Level 3: Front Foot Elevated (Full Range)
**Setup:**
1. Place front foot on 2-4 inch platform (aerobic step or plate)
2. Back foot on bench behind you
3. This increases range of motion significantly

**Execution:**
1. Lower as deep as mobility allows
2. Feel the stretch in back leg's hip flexor at bottom
3. Drive up with control

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 6-8 reps per leg
- Add weight only when bodyweight is smooth

**Key:** The elevation allows you to go deeper without the back knee hitting the ground. This is where the magic happens for hip flexor mobility.

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Keep torso upright (chest proud)
- Track front knee over toes
- Control the descent (2-3 seconds down)
- Drive through the front heel
- Keep hips square (don't rotate)

**Don't:**
- Lean forward excessively
- Let front knee collapse inward
- Rush through reps
- Bounce at the bottom
- Place back foot too close to front

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Front knee caving in | Push knee out over pinky toe |
| Torso leaning forward | Brace core, chest up |
| Losing balance | Widen stance laterally |
| Back foot cramping | Adjust foot position on bench |
| Not going deep enough | Elevate front foot, or work on hip mobility |

## Scaling Options

### Easier:
- Bodyweight only
- Hold onto wall or rack for balance
- Reduce range of motion
- Both feet on floor (no elevation)

### Harder:
- Add dumbbells at sides
- Front foot elevated 4-6 inches
- Goblet hold (single dumbbell at chest)
- Pause 2-3 seconds at bottom

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 2x per week
**Sets/Reps:** 3-4 sets x 6-12 reps per leg (depending on level)
**Rest:** 60-90 seconds between legs

**Progression path:**
1. Bodyweight floor split squat → 
2. Rear foot elevated → 
3. Add dumbbells → 
4. Front foot elevated → 
5. Add dumbbells to front foot elevated

Don't rush the progressions. Each level builds the mobility and stability for the next.
