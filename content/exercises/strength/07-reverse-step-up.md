# Reverse Step-Up

## Overview
The reverse step-up is a unilateral lower body exercise where you step BACKWARD off a platform rather than forward. This creates more glute and hamstring emphasis than traditional step-ups, and it's easier on the knees.

## Why It Matters
Strong glutes are the foundation of a healthy lower back. When your glutes don't fire properly, your lower back picks up the slack. The reverse step-up teaches your glutes to work through hip extension while building single-leg stability.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Glutes, hamstrings
- **Secondary:** Quadriceps, core (balance)

## Equipment
- Step platform or box (4-12 inches)
- Dumbbells (optional)

## Execution

### Setup
1. Stand on top of a low platform (4-6 inches to start)
2. Feet hip-width apart
3. Dumbbells at sides (optional — start bodyweight)

### The Movement
1. **Step Back:** Reach one foot backward off the platform
2. **Lower:** Slowly lower until back foot touches ground
3. **Drive:** Press through front heel to return to starting position
4. **Squeeze:** Contract glute at top
5. **Repeat:** All reps on one leg, then switch

### Protocol
- 3 sets x 10-12 reps per leg
- Tempo: 2 seconds down, 1 second pause, 1 second up
- Rest: 60 seconds between legs

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: Low Box, Bodyweight
- 4-6 inch platform
- Bodyweight only
- Focus on balance and control
- 3 x 10-12 per leg

### Level 2: Medium Box, Bodyweight
- 8-10 inch platform
- Greater range of motion
- 3 x 10-12 per leg

### Level 3: Low Box, Weighted
- 4-6 inch platform
- Hold dumbbells at sides (10-25 lbs each)
- 3 x 10-12 per leg

### Level 4: Medium Box, Weighted
- 8-10 inch platform
- Dumbbells at sides
- 3 x 8-10 per leg

### Level 5: High Box, Weighted
- 12+ inch platform
- Challenging balance and strength
- 3 x 6-8 per leg

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Control the descent — no dropping
- Drive through the HEEL of the standing leg
- Keep chest up, torso upright
- Squeeze glute at the top of each rep
- Keep hips level — don't let them shift side to side

**Don't:**
- Push off with the back foot
- Lean forward excessively
- Rush through reps
- Let standing knee cave inward
- Use a box that's too high (start low)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Pushing off back foot | Lightly touch ground, don't push |
| Knee caving in | Push knee out over toes |
| Leaning forward | Keep chest proud, core braced |
| Going too fast | Slow down — control the movement |
| Box too high | Start with 4-6 inches and progress |
| Losing balance | Hold onto wall initially |

## Why "Reverse" Instead of Forward?

Traditional forward step-ups emphasize the quadriceps and can stress the knee.

Reverse step-ups:
- Shift emphasis to glutes and hamstrings
- Reduce knee stress
- Create a more natural hip hinge pattern
- Better carryover to walking and running mechanics

For lower back rehab, glute-dominant exercises are generally preferred.

## Scaling Options

### Easier:
- Lower box height
- Hold wall for balance
- Bodyweight only
- Reduce range of motion (don't touch ground)

### Harder:
- Higher box
- Add dumbbells
- Pause at bottom position
- Deficit (back foot lands on lower surface)

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 2x per week
**When:** After main lower body compounds, or as standalone leg day
**Pairing:** Works well with Romanian deadlifts and hip thrusts

**Progression:**
- Master bodyweight with perfect form
- Increase box height before adding weight
- Then add weight at the lower height
- Work back up with weight
