# KOT Calf Raise

## Overview
The KOT (Knees Over Toes) calf raise is a full range of motion calf exercise that strengthens the gastrocnemius and soleus through their complete length. Unlike standard calf raises, you'll go all the way down into a deep stretch, training the muscle at its longest position.

## Why It Matters
The calves connect to the hamstrings via the Achilles tendon and fascial chains. Tight, weak calves contribute to limited ankle mobility, which forces the hips and lower back to compensate during squatting and bending. Strong, mobile calves = better movement = less back pain.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Gastrocnemius, soleus
- **Secondary:** Tibialis posterior, peroneals

## Equipment
- Elevated surface (step, block, or plate)
- Wall or rack for balance
- Dumbbells or barbell (advanced)

## Execution

### Setup
1. Stand on edge of step with balls of feet on surface
2. Heels hanging off the edge
3. Light touch on wall for balance (not support)

### The Movement
1. **Lower:** Drop heels as far below the step as possible (2-3 seconds)
2. **Pause:** Hold stretched position for 1 second
3. **Raise:** Drive up onto toes as high as possible (1-2 seconds)
4. **Pause:** Squeeze at top for 1 second
5. **Repeat**

### Protocol
- 3 sets x 15-20 reps
- Tempo: 3 seconds down, 1 second pause, 2 seconds up, 1 second pause
- Rest: 60 seconds between sets

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: Two-Leg Bodyweight
- Both feet on step
- Full range of motion
- Focus on control and stretch
- 3 x 15-20 reps

### Level 2: Single-Leg Bodyweight
- One foot on step, other leg lifted
- Use wall for balance as needed
- 3 x 10-15 reps per leg

### Level 3: Two-Leg Weighted
- Hold dumbbells at sides
- Or barbell on back
- Start light (10-20 lbs added)
- 3 x 12-15 reps

### Level 4: Single-Leg Weighted
- One leg, holding dumbbell
- 3 x 8-12 reps per leg
- This is advanced — earn it

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Go ALL the way down — max stretch
- Go ALL the way up — max contraction
- Control the movement throughout
- Keep knees straight (slight bend is okay)
- Maintain balance with light touch, not grip

**Don't:**
- Bounce at the bottom
- Rush through reps
- Use momentum
- Let ankles roll inward or outward
- Grip the wall — just light touch

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Not going deep enough | Lower heels until you feel strong stretch |
| Bouncing at bottom | Pause 1 second at bottom position |
| Leaning on wall | Touch wall lightly — balance yourself |
| Knees bending excessively | Keep legs relatively straight |
| Going too fast | Slow down — 3 seconds down minimum |

## Why "Full Range" Matters

Most calf raises only train the shortened position. You push up, come down a little, and repeat. This creates strong but SHORT calves.

The KOT calf raise fixes this by:
1. Training the muscle at full length (stretched position)
2. Building strength through the entire range
3. Improving ankle dorsiflexion mobility
4. Protecting against Achilles tendon issues

Your calves should be strong AND long. This exercise delivers both.

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 3x per week (calves recover fast)
**When:** End of lower body workout, or as standalone work
**Volume:** 3-4 sets, 10-20 reps depending on level

**Progression:**
- Master 3 x 20 before adding weight
- Master 3 x 15 single-leg before adding weight to single-leg
- Small weight increases (5-10 lbs)

**Pairing:** Works well with tibialis raises (opposite movement pattern)
