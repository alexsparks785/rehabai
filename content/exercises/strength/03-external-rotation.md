# External Rotation

## Overview
External rotation exercises strengthen the rotator cuff and posterior shoulder while teaching proper shoulder mechanics. For lower back rehab, healthy shoulders mean better posture and less compensatory stress on the spine.

## Why It Matters
When your shoulders are weak or immobile, your thoracic spine compensates. When your thoracic spine is stuck, your lumbar spine compensates. Fixing the shoulders is upstream prevention for back pain.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Infraspinatus, teres minor (rotator cuff)
- **Secondary:** Posterior deltoid, rhomboids

## Equipment
- Light dumbbell (5-15 lbs to start)
- Bench or chair

## Seated Dumbbell External Rotation

### Setup
1. Sit on bench with feet flat on floor
2. Hold dumbbell in one hand
3. Rest elbow on same-side thigh, forearm hanging down
4. Palm faces inward toward opposite leg

### Execution
1. Keeping elbow pinned to thigh, rotate forearm outward
2. Lift dumbbell in an arc until forearm is parallel to ground (or slightly beyond)
3. Pause 1 second at top
4. Lower with control (2-3 seconds)
5. Repeat for all reps, then switch sides

### Protocol
- 3 sets x 12-15 reps per arm
- Rest 30-45 seconds between sets
- Tempo: 1 second up, 1 second hold, 2-3 seconds down

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: No Weight
- Same movement pattern
- Focus on feeling the rotator cuff engage
- 3 x 15-20 reps per arm

### Level 2: Light Dumbbell (5-10 lbs)
- Standard protocol above
- Master this before adding weight

### Level 3: Moderate Dumbbell (10-15 lbs)
- 3-4 sets x 10-12 reps
- Only progress when Level 2 is easy with perfect form

### Level 4: Incline Bench Variation
- Lie face-down on incline bench (30-45 degrees)
- Arms hang straight down, rotate outward
- More challenging due to gravity angle

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Keep elbow firmly planted on thigh
- Move ONLY at the shoulder — no wrist rotation
- Control the descent (eccentric is important)
- Keep shoulder blade pulled back and down

**Don't:**
- Use momentum or swing the weight
- Let elbow lift off thigh
- Rotate past comfortable range
- Rush the movement

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Elbow lifting off thigh | Press elbow down firmly, use lighter weight |
| Using wrist rotation | Lock wrist in neutral — only shoulder moves |
| Going too heavy | If you can't control the descent, it's too heavy |
| Rushing reps | Slow down — 2-3 second lowering phase |
| Shrugging shoulder | Keep shoulder blade down and back |

## Alternative Variations

### Cable External Rotation
- Stand sideways to cable machine
- Elbow at 90 degrees, pinned to side
- Rotate forearm away from machine
- Great for constant tension

### Band External Rotation
- Attach band to fixed point at elbow height
- Same movement as cable version
- Good for travel/home workouts

### Side-Lying External Rotation
- Lie on side, top arm's elbow on hip
- Rotate forearm toward ceiling
- Classic PT exercise

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 2-3x per week
**When:** As part of warm-up or as accessory work after main lifts
**Pairing:** Works well with rows and face pulls

**Progression:** Add weight only when you can complete all reps with perfect form and controlled tempo. Small jumps (2.5-5 lbs) are fine.
