# Side Bend Progression

## Overview
The side bend is a lateral flexion exercise that targets the obliques and quadratus lumborum (QL). For lower back health, balanced strength and mobility in lateral flexion is often overlooked — most people only train forward/backward movements.

## Why It Matters
The QL connects your pelvis to your lower ribs and spine. When it's tight or weak on one side, it creates asymmetric tension on your lower back. Side bends restore balance and improve resilience to rotational and lateral forces.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Obliques (internal and external), quadratus lumborum
- **Secondary:** Erector spinae, intercostals, hip stabilizers

## Equipment
- Bench or chair (seated variations)
- Dumbbell (weighted variations)

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: Seated Side Bend (Stretch Focus)

**Setup:**
1. Sit on bench, feet flat on floor
2. Place one hand behind head
3. Other hand can rest on thigh or bench

**Execution:**
1. Laterally flex spine — bend to one side
2. Reach overhead hand toward opposite side
3. Feel stretch along side of torso
4. Hold 20-30 seconds
5. Return to center, switch sides

**Protocol:**
- 3 rounds per side
- Hold 20-30 seconds each
- This is a STRETCH, not a strength exercise

**Key Cue:** "Gently bend to the side and pull back" — don't force it

---

### Level 2: Active Side Bend (Mobility)

**Setup:**
1. Same seated position
2. Both hands behind head

**Execution:**
1. Bend to one side with control
2. Pause briefly at end range
3. Return to center using obliques
4. Repeat to same side, then switch

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 8-10 reps per side
- Slow and controlled movement
- Focus on feeling the obliques work

---

### Level 3: Standing Side Bend (Light Weight)

**Setup:**
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart
2. Hold light dumbbell in one hand (10-20 lbs)
3. Other hand behind head or on hip

**Execution:**
1. Bend away from the weight (stretches weighted side)
2. Return to neutral by contracting the weighted side oblique
3. All reps on one side, then switch

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 10-12 reps per side
- Don't go excessively heavy — this is mobility work

---

### Level 4: Weighted Side Bend (Strength)

**Setup:**
1. Stand with feet hip-width
2. Hold heavier dumbbell (25-50 lbs)
3. Free hand on hip

**Execution:**
1. Lower the weight by bending to that side
2. Keep shoulders square (no rotation)
3. Return to neutral by contracting opposite oblique
4. Controlled tempo throughout

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 10-12 reps per side
- Focus on the oblique contraction, not the weight

---

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Move only in the lateral plane (side to side)
- Keep hips stationary — movement comes from spine
- Control the range of motion (don't force end range)
- Breathe normally throughout

**Don't:**
- Rotate the torso (no twisting)
- Lean forward or backward
- Rush through reps
- Use excessive weight
- Force the stretch beyond comfortable range

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Rotating torso | Face forward, move only side-to-side |
| Hips shifting | Keep pelvis stable and level |
| Going too heavy | Side bends are mobility-focused — light weight |
| Forcing end range | Stop where you feel moderate stretch |
| Bouncing | Slow, controlled movement |

## Asymmetry Notes

Most people have one side tighter than the other. This is normal.

**What to do:**
- Note which side is tighter
- Spend extra time (30-60 seconds more) on the tight side
- Don't force equal range — let it develop naturally
- Track progress over weeks/months

From the video: "You may get deeper on your left than right" — this is expected and okay.

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 2-3x per week
**When:** As part of warm-up or cool-down, or as accessory work
**Purpose:** Mobility and balance, not max strength

**Progression:**
1. Master seated stretch holds
2. Progress to active movement
3. Add light weight only when mobility is good
4. Never prioritize weight over range of motion
