# Back Extension

## Overview
The back extension is the foundational exercise for rebuilding lower back strength and endurance. Using a Roman chair or hyperextension bench, you'll train your spinal erectors to maintain neutral spine position under load — the key to a pain-free back.

## Why It Matters
Your erector spinae muscles run along your entire spine. When they're weak or have poor endurance, your spine loses stability during everyday movements. This exercise rebuilds that foundation, starting with isometric holds before progressing to dynamic movement.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Erector spinae (spinal erectors), multifidus
- **Secondary:** Glutes, hamstrings

## Equipment
- 45-degree back extension bench (Roman chair) or GHD

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: Isometric Hold (Beginner)
**Goal:** Build up to a 2-minute hold in neutral spine position

**Setup:**
1. Position hips on the pad, ankles secured under rollers
2. Cross arms over chest
3. Lower torso to approximately 45 degrees (not fully flexed)
4. Hold neutral spine — no rounding, no hyperextension

**Protocol:**
- Start with 3 x 30-second holds
- Add 10 seconds per session until you reach 2 minutes
- Rest 60 seconds between holds

**Key Cues:**
- "Long spine" — imagine a rod running from tailbone to head
- Breathe normally — don't hold breath
- If you can't maintain neutral, the set is over

---

### Level 2: Partial Range (Intermediate)
**Goal:** Controlled movement through 10-20 degrees of motion

**Setup:**
1. Same position as Level 1
2. Start at neutral (horizontal)

**Execution:**
1. Lower torso 10-20 degrees (small movement)
2. Return to neutral with control
3. Pause 1 second at top

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 10-15 reps
- Tempo: 2 seconds down, 1 second pause, 2 seconds up
- Rest 60 seconds between sets

**Key Cues:**
- "Move from hips, not lower back"
- Keep the range small — this isn't about depth
- Stop if you feel lower back rounding

---

### Level 3: Full Range (Advanced)
**Goal:** Full hip hinge with load

**Setup:**
1. Same position
2. Optional: hold weight plate at chest

**Execution:**
1. Lower torso until you feel hamstring/glute stretch (approximately 45-60 degrees)
2. Drive hips into pad and return to neutral
3. Do NOT hyperextend at top

**Protocol:**
- 3-4 sets x 8-12 reps
- Add weight only when bodyweight feels easy
- Start with 5-10 lb plate

**Key Cues:**
- "Hinge at hips, not spine"
- Squeeze glutes at top — don't arch past neutral
- Control the descent — no dropping

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Hyperextending at top | Stop when torso is parallel to ground |
| Rounding lower back at bottom | Reduce range of motion |
| Using momentum | Slow down — 2 second tempo each direction |
| Holding breath | Exhale on the way up, inhale on the way down |
| Going too heavy too soon | Master bodyweight for 15+ reps first |

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 2-3x per week
**When to progress:** When you can complete all sets/reps with perfect form for 2 consecutive sessions
**Recovery:** If lower back feels fatigued (not painful), take an extra rest day

## Red Flags — Stop If:
- Sharp pain in lower back
- Pain radiating down leg
- Numbness or tingling
- Pain that worsens with each rep

These may indicate you're not ready for this exercise or need to regress to an earlier level.
