# Pigeon Strength

## Overview
Pigeon strength combines the classic pigeon stretch with active strengthening. Instead of just hanging out in the stretch, you'll contract the muscles being stretched — building strength and control through deep hip external rotation and flexion.

## Why It Matters
The pigeon position stretches the piriformis, glutes, and hip external rotators — muscles that get tight from sitting and can compress the sciatic nerve. Adding strength work to the stretch creates lasting mobility and teaches your hips to be strong in deep ranges.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Piriformis, gluteus maximus, hip external rotators
- **Secondary:** Hip flexors (back leg), glute medius, deep hip muscles

## Equipment
- Exercise mat
- Yoga blocks (optional, for assistance)
- Nordstick or anchor (optional, for loaded version)

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: Passive Pigeon Stretch

**Setup:**
1. Start in tabletop position (hands and knees)
2. Bring right knee forward, placing it behind right wrist
3. Right shin angled (doesn't need to be parallel to front edge of mat)
4. Left leg extends straight back, top of foot on floor
5. Square hips as much as possible

**Execution:**
1. Walk hands forward, lowering torso toward floor
2. Rest on forearms or all the way down
3. Relax and breathe into the stretch
4. Hold 60-90 seconds
5. Switch sides

**Protocol:**
- Hold 60-90 seconds per side
- 2-3 rounds each side
- Focus on relaxation and deep breathing

### Level 2: Supported Pigeon (Modified)

**Setup:**
- Same as Level 1
- Place yoga block under front hip for support

**Purpose:**
- Reduces intensity if hips are tight
- Allows square hips without strain
- Good for beginners

**Protocol:**
- Same timing as Level 1
- Progress to no block when ready

---

### Level 3: Active Pigeon (Pigeon Strength)

**Setup:**
1. Come into pigeon position
2. Stay upright (hands on floor beside hips)
3. Keep torso tall

**Execution:**
1. **Press down:** Push front shin into floor (activates external rotators)
2. **Hold:** 5-10 seconds of pressing
3. **Release:** Relax the push
4. **Repeat:** 5-8 presses per side

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 5-8 active presses per side
- Each press: 5-10 second hold
- This builds strength in the stretched position

---

### Level 4: Loaded Pigeon

**Setup:**
1. Pigeon position with anchor device (Nordstick or similar)
2. Front leg anchored
3. Or: hold weight plate at chest

**Execution:**
1. Maintain pigeon position under load
2. Work to lift torso upright with the added resistance
3. Hold position, breathe

**Protocol:**
- Hold 30-60 seconds with load
- 2-3 rounds per side
- This is advanced — earn it

---

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Square hips as much as possible (both hip bones facing forward)
- Keep back leg straight and extended
- Flex front foot (protects knee)
- Breathe deeply into the stretch
- For active version: PRESS shin into floor to engage muscles

**Don't:**
- Let front hip lift significantly higher than back hip
- Collapse into the stretch without engagement
- Force depth before you're ready
- Let front knee hurt (adjust angle if needed)
- Hold breath

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Hips not square | Use block under front hip |
| Front knee pain | Change shin angle (more acute angle) |
| Lower back arching | Tuck pelvis slightly |
| No muscle engagement | Press shin into floor |
| Rushing | Slow down — this is deep work |

## Why "Strength" Matters

Passive pigeon = temporary flexibility
Active pigeon = lasting mobility + strength

When you **contract** the muscles being stretched (pressing shin into floor), you:
1. Signal to nervous system that the position is safe
2. Build strength at end range
3. Create mobility that sticks
4. Prepare the muscles to be loaded in this range

This is why it's called "Pigeon STRENGTH" — not just pigeon stretch.

## Modifications

### If front knee hurts:
- Change shin angle (more acute)
- Use block under hip
- Do reclined pigeon (lying on back) instead

### If back hip is too tight:
- Place blanket under back knee
- Focus on Level 1-2 before progressing

### If you can't square hips:
- Use block under front hip
- This will improve with time

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 3-5x per week
**When:** Warm-up, cool-down, or dedicated mobility session
**Duration:** 5-10 minutes total (both sides, multiple rounds)

**Progression:**
1. Master passive holds (2 minutes per side)
2. Add active pressing
3. Increase press duration
4. Add load when pressing is strong

**Timeline:** Expect 4-8 weeks of consistent work for noticeable improvement
