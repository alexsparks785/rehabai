# Active Hang (Optional)

## Overview
The active hang is a decompression exercise where you hang from a bar while engaging your shoulders and lats. It creates space in the spine, stretches the lats and shoulders, and builds grip strength — all while being gentle on the lower back.

## Why It Matters
Gravity compresses your spine all day. Hanging reverses this by creating traction, allowing the intervertebral discs to rehydrate and the spinal muscles to relax. For lower back rehab, this is passive decompression with active shoulder engagement.

## Target Muscles/Joints
- **Primary:** Lats, shoulders (stretched), spine (decompressed)
- **Secondary:** Grip, forearms, scapular stabilizers

## Equipment
- Pull-up bar or gymnastics rings
- Sturdy overhead structure

## Execution

### Passive Hang (Start Here)
1. Grip bar with hands shoulder-width apart
2. Let body hang with arms fully extended
3. Relax shoulders UP toward ears (passive)
4. Breathe deeply
5. Accumulate time

### Active Hang (Progression)
1. Same starting position
2. Pull shoulders DOWN away from ears (engage lats)
3. Keep arms straight — no bending
4. Hold the active position
5. Release back to passive, repeat

## Protocol

**Goal:** Accumulate 1 minute total

**Options:**
- 6 x 10 seconds
- 4 x 15 seconds
- 3 x 20 seconds
- 2 x 30 seconds
- 1 x 60 seconds (goal)

Rest as needed between sets. Focus on relaxed breathing.

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Grip firmly but not death-grip
- Breathe deeply into belly
- Let spine decompress naturally
- For active: pull shoulder blades down and back

**Don't:**
- Swing or kip
- Hold breath
- Strain neck
- Force longer holds than you can manage

## Progression

### Level 1: Assisted Hang
- Feet on floor or box, partial bodyweight
- Build grip endurance

### Level 2: Passive Hang
- Full bodyweight, shoulders relaxed
- Work toward 30-60 second holds

### Level 3: Active Hang
- Engage lats, pull shoulders down
- Maintain active position for time

### Level 4: Active Hang with Movement
- Add gentle side-to-side swaying
- Or scapular shrugs (up/down while hanging)

## Why This Is Optional

Not everyone has access to a pull-up bar, and some people with shoulder issues may need to skip this exercise. It's valuable but not essential for the core lower back program.

If you can do it, do it. If you can't, focus on the other exercises.
