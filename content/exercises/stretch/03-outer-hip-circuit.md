# Outer Hip Circuit

## Overview
The outer hip circuit is a series of exercises that strengthen and mobilize the hip abductors — the muscles on the outside of your hip that stabilize your pelvis during walking and standing on one leg. This circuit includes fire hydrants, clamshells, and lateral movements.

## Why It Matters
Weak hip abductors (especially glute medius) cause your pelvis to drop on one side during walking. Your lower back then works overtime to stabilize. Strong outer hips = stable pelvis = less back compensation.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Gluteus medius, gluteus minimus
- **Secondary:** Tensor fasciae latae (TFL), piriformis, hip external rotators

## Equipment
- Exercise mat
- Resistance band (optional)

## The Circuit

Complete all exercises in sequence. Rest 30 seconds between exercises, 60-90 seconds between rounds.

### 1. Fire Hydrants

**Setup:**
1. Start on hands and knees (quadruped position)
2. Hands under shoulders, knees under hips
3. Core braced, spine neutral

**Execution:**
1. Keep knee bent at 90 degrees
2. Lift one leg out to the side (like a dog at a fire hydrant)
3. Lift until thigh is parallel to ground (or as high as possible without rotating hips)
4. Lower with control
5. Repeat all reps, then switch sides

**Reps:** 12-15 per side

**Cues:**
- Keep hips square — don't rotate
- Move from the hip, not the lower back
- Control the movement — no swinging

### 2. Clamshells

**Setup:**
1. Lie on side, knees bent 90 degrees
2. Feet stacked, hips stacked
3. Head resting on bottom arm
4. Top hand on hip to monitor pelvic rotation

**Execution:**
1. Keeping feet together, open top knee toward ceiling
2. Open as far as possible WITHOUT rotating pelvis backward
3. Pause at top for 1-2 seconds
4. Lower with control
5. Repeat all reps, then switch sides

**Reps:** 15-20 per side

**Cues:**
- Pelvis DOES NOT MOVE — only knee opens
- Feel the burn deep in the glute, not hip flexor
- Slow, controlled movement

---

### 3. Side-Lying Hip Abduction (Leg Raise)

**Setup:**
1. Lie on side, bottom leg bent for stability
2. Top leg straight
3. Top foot slightly in front of body (prevents hip flexor dominance)

**Execution:**
1. Lift top leg toward ceiling
2. Lead with the heel, not the toe
3. Lift until you feel outer hip engage (usually 30-45 degrees)
4. Lower with control
5. Repeat all reps, then switch sides

**Reps:** 15-20 per side

**Cues:**
- Lead with HEEL — if you lead with toe, hip flexor takes over
- Keep leg slightly in front of body
- Don't roll backward

---

### 4. Quadruped Hip Circles

**Setup:**
1. Back to hands and knees
2. Core braced

**Execution:**
1. Lift one knee off ground
2. Make slow circles with the knee (forward, out, back, in)
3. Complete 5 circles in one direction
4. Reverse direction for 5 circles
5. Switch legs

**Reps:** 5 circles each direction, each leg

**Cues:**
- Keep circles controlled — no momentum
- Keep hips as stable as possible
- Feel the hip joint moving through range

## Full Circuit Protocol

| Exercise | Reps | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Fire Hydrants | 12-15 each side | Slow and controlled |
| Clamshells | 15-20 each side | Don't rotate pelvis |
| Side-Lying Abduction | 15-20 each side | Lead with heel |
| Hip Circles | 5 each direction, each leg | Full range |

**Rest:** 30 seconds between exercises, 60-90 seconds between rounds
**Rounds:** 2-3 total

---

## Progression Options

### Easier:
- Reduce reps
- Smaller range of motion
- Longer rest between exercises

### Harder:
- Add resistance band above knees (clamshells)
- Add ankle weight (side-lying abduction)
- Increase reps
- Reduce rest time
- Add pause at top of each rep

## Common Mistakes

| Exercise | Mistake | Fix |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Fire Hydrants | Rotating hips | Keep hips square to ground |
| Clamshells | Pelvis rolling back | Hand on hip to monitor |
| Side Abduction | Leading with toe | Lead with heel |
| Hip Circles | Rushing | Slow, controlled circles |
| All | Using momentum | Slow down |

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 3-5x per week
**When:** Warm-up before lower body work, or standalone hip work
**Duration:** 10-15 minutes for full circuit (2-3 rounds)

**Signs it's working:**
- Less hip drop during single-leg stance
- Better balance on one leg
- Reduced lower back fatigue during walking
- Glute medius "burn" during exercises (not hip flexor)
