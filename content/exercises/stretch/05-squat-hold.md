# Squat Hold

## Overview
The squat hold (also called the deep squat or Asian squat) is the foundational human resting position. By simply sitting in a deep squat for time, you restore ankle, knee, and hip mobility while decompressing the spine and opening the hips.

## Why It Matters
Humans evolved to squat. It's how we rested before chairs existed. The deep squat stretches the ankles, knees, hips, and lower back simultaneously while strengthening the legs and core. If you can't hold a deep squat comfortably, you have mobility restrictions that are likely contributing to back pain.

## Target Muscles/Joints
- **Ankles:** Dorsiflexion mobility
- **Knees:** Full flexion
- **Hips:** Flexion, external rotation, adductors
- **Lower back:** Gentle flexion stretch
- **Groin:** Opening and lengthening

## Equipment
- None required
- Optional: heels elevated on plate or wedge
- Optional: pole/TRX for balance assistance

## Execution

### Basic Squat Hold

**Setup:**
1. Stand with feet roughly shoulder-width apart
2. Toes can point out 15-30 degrees (whatever feels natural)

**Getting into position:**
1. Slowly lower into a deep squat
2. Keep heels on ground (or elevated on a wedge if needed)
3. Let knees track over toes (knees can go past toes — that's fine)
4. Allow your hips to sink as low as possible
5. Find a comfortable position and STAY

**Holding:**
1. Relax into the position
2. Breathe deeply — let the groin and hips sink
3. Arms can be forward for balance, or hands in prayer position
4. Hold for time

**Protocol:**
- Start with 30-60 seconds
- Build to 2-5 minute holds
- Multiple rounds if needed

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: Assisted Squat Hold

**Setup:**
- Hold onto doorframe, TRX strap, or sturdy object
- Use assistance to get into position and maintain balance

**Protocol:**
- 3-5 x 30-60 second holds
- Gradually reduce assistance over time

---

### Level 2: Heels Elevated

**Setup:**
- Place heels on 1-2 inch elevation (plate, wedge, or rolled towel)
- This compensates for limited ankle mobility

**Protocol:**
- 3-5 x 60-90 second holds
- Lower the elevation as mobility improves

---

### Level 3: Flat Foot, Unassisted

**Setup:**
- Heels on ground
- No external support

**Protocol:**
- Build to 2-minute continuous holds
- This is the standard goal

---

### Level 4: Movement in Squat

**Once Level 3 is comfortable:**
- Rock side to side
- Shift weight forward and back
- Rotate torso left and right
- "Clean" the inside of the squat — explore the range

**Protocol:**
- 2-3 minutes of active mobility work in squat position

---

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Keep heels down (or use elevation if needed)
- Let knees track over toes
- Allow "groin to sink in" — let hips open
- Keep spine relatively neutral (slight rounding is okay)
- Breathe deeply and relax

**Don't:**
- Force the position if painful
- Let heels come up (use elevation instead)
- Hold tension — relax into it
- Round excessively through upper back
- Give up too soon — it takes time

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Heels coming up | Elevate heels on plate or wedge |
| Falling backward | Widen stance, toes out more |
| Knee pain | Adjust stance width and toe angle |
| Lower back pain | Check for excessive rounding, regress |
| Can't relax | Use assistance and breathe |

## The "Groin Sink" Cue

From the videos: "Let the groin sink in"

This means:
- Allow your hips to truly OPEN
- Don't fight gravity — let your body weight pull you down
- Breathe into the hip crease
- Feel the adductors (inner thigh) stretching
- Let your pelvis drop between your ankles

This is where mobility is gained — in the relaxation.

## Why Daily Squat Practice

Sitting in chairs has stolen your squat. To get it back:

**Ideal:** 10-30 minutes of squat accumulation per day
**Minimum:** 3-5 minutes per day

This can be broken up:
- 1 minute while waiting for coffee
- 2 minutes while watching TV
- 1 minute while scrolling phone

Every minute counts. The squat is a use-it-or-lose-it position.

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** Daily
**Duration:** Work toward 5-10 minute total daily accumulation
**When:** Anytime — morning, throughout day, evening

**Progression timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Assisted holds, heels elevated
- Week 3-4: Reduce assistance and elevation
- Month 2+: Flat foot, unassisted holds
- Month 3+: Adding movement in squat

**The goal:** Being able to hang out in a deep squat for 5+ minutes comfortably, anywhere, anytime.
