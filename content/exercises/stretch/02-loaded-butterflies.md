# Loaded Butterflies

## Overview
Loaded butterflies combine the classic butterfly stretch with active strengthening through the range. Using a Tib Bar or weights, you'll open the hips while building strength in the adductors and hip external rotators — creating lasting mobility gains.

## Why It Matters
Passive stretching alone creates temporary flexibility that disappears within hours. Loaded stretching builds STRENGTH through the new range, teaching your nervous system that the position is safe. This creates mobility that sticks.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Hip adductors (inner thigh), hip external rotators
- **Secondary:** Hip flexors, glutes, pelvic floor

## Equipment
- Tib Bar, Monkeyfoot, or ankle weights
- Or: Weight plate held at chest
- Or: Resistance band around feet

## Basic Butterfly (Warm-Up)

### Setup
1. Sit on floor with soles of feet together
2. Knees out to sides
3. Hands on ankles or feet
4. Sit tall — don't round back

### Execution
1. Gently press knees toward floor
2. Hinge forward from hips (not by rounding spine)
3. Hold for 60 seconds
4. Breathe deeply into the stretch

## Loaded Butterfly Progressions

### Level 1: Weighted Butterfly Hold

**Setup:**
1. Butterfly position
2. Hold weight plate at chest (goblet position)
3. Or: place weight plate on top of each thigh

**Execution:**
1. Let the weight gently press knees toward floor
2. Maintain upright torso
3. Hold for 60-120 seconds
4. Breathe and relax into position

**Protocol:**
- 2-3 holds of 60-120 seconds
- Start with 10-20 lb plate

### Level 2: Active Butterfly Press

**Setup:**
1. Butterfly position
2. Hands on inside of knees

**Execution:**
1. Press knees down toward floor using hip strength
2. Hold at bottom for 5 seconds
3. Relax, let knees float up slightly
4. Press down again
5. Repeat

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 8-10 presses
- Focus on ACTIVE engagement, not passive stretch

---

### Level 3: Banded Butterfly

**Setup:**
1. Butterfly position
2. Resistance band looped around both feet
3. Band creates tension pulling feet apart

**Execution:**
1. Resist the band with adductors
2. Actively press knees toward floor
3. Hold 3-5 seconds
4. Relax slightly, repeat

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 10-12 reps
- Light band tension to start

---

### Level 4: Tib Bar / Ankle Weight Butterflies

**Setup:**
1. Butterfly position
2. Tib Bar or ankle weights attached to feet
3. Weight creates resistance as knees lower

**Execution:**
1. Lower knees toward floor against weight
2. Control the movement — don't just drop
3. Pause at bottom
4. Return with control

**Protocol:**
- 3 sets x 10-15 reps
- Very light weight (5-10 lbs total)

---

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- Sit tall — avoid rounding lower back
- Keep soles of feet together
- Breathe deeply into stretch
- Control all movements
- Progress slowly — this is deep work

**Don't:**
- Round your back (keeps hips from opening)
- Force knees to floor with hands (use hip muscles instead)
- Bounce or pulse aggressively
- Rush through reps
- Use excessive weight

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Rounding lower back | Sit taller, hinge from hips |
| Forcing with hands | Use hip muscles to press knees down |
| Feet too far from body | Pull feet closer to groin |
| Feet too close to body | Slide feet further out if knees don't lower |
| Excessive weight | Start very light — 5-10 lbs |

## The Difference: Passive vs. Loaded

**Passive stretching:**
- Just sit in position
- Temporary flexibility gains
- Doesn't build strength in the range
- Often "bounces back" after stretch ends

**Loaded stretching:**
- Active muscle engagement through range
- Builds strength at end range
- Nervous system learns position is safe
- Creates lasting mobility improvements

This is why we "load" the butterfly — to make the gains permanent.

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** 3-5x per week
**When:** Part of warm-up, cool-down, or dedicated mobility work
**Duration:** 2-5 minutes total per session

**Progression:**
1. Master passive butterfly (60+ second holds)
2. Add light weight (10-20 lbs)
3. Progress to active pressing
4. Add bands or Tib Bar for resistance

**Timeline:** Expect 4-8 weeks before significant hip opening
