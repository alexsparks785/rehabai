# Couch Stretch

## Overview
The couch stretch is the gold standard hip flexor stretch. By placing your back foot against a wall (or couch), you create a deep stretch for the rectus femoris (quad) and psoas (hip flexor) — muscles that get chronically shortened from sitting.

## Why It Matters
Tight hip flexors pull your pelvis forward (anterior pelvic tilt), which increases the curve in your lower back and creates chronic lumbar compression. The couch stretch reverses this pattern by lengthening the tissues that have been shortened from hours of sitting.

## Target Muscles
- **Primary:** Rectus femoris, psoas, iliacus
- **Secondary:** Quadriceps, hip capsule

## Equipment
- Wall or couch
- Pad or mat for knee (optional)
- Stick or pole for assistance (beginner)

## Progression Levels

### Level 1: Knee on Floor — Assisted

**Setup:**
1. Place one knee on the ground, near a wall
2. Back foot goes against the wall (top of foot on wall)
3. Front foot flat on floor, knee at 90 degrees
4. Hold a stick or pole for balance
5. Torso upright

**Execution:**
1. Tuck your tailbone under (posterior pelvic tilt)
2. Squeeze the glute on the back leg side
3. You should feel stretch in front of hip/thigh
4. Hold position

**Protocol:**
- Hold 60-90 seconds per side
- 2-3 rounds per side
- Use the stick for balance as needed

**Key Cue:** "Knee on the floor, start assisted" — don't force depth before you have the mobility.

---

### Level 2: Knee on Floor — No Assistance

**Setup:**
- Same as Level 1
- Remove the stick/pole

**Execution:**
- Same cues: tuck tailbone, squeeze glute
- Hands can be on hips or front thigh
- Focus on staying upright without support

**Protocol:**
- Hold 90-120 seconds per side
- 2-3 rounds

---

### Level 3: Elevated Position

**Setup:**
1. Back knee on elevated surface (bench or couch)
2. Back foot against wall behind you
3. Front foot on floor, stepped out further

**Execution:**
- Creates deeper hip flexor stretch
- Maintain pelvic tuck throughout
- Only progress here when Level 2 is comfortable

**Protocol:**
- Hold 60-90 seconds per side
- 2 rounds

---

### Level 4: Hands-Free, Full Upright

**Setup:**
- Level 3 position
- Arms overhead or hands behind head

**Execution:**
- Full upright torso, no forward lean
- Maximum hip flexor stretch
- This takes months to achieve for most people

**Protocol:**
- Hold 60-120 seconds
- This is the maintenance goal

---

## Form Cues

**Do:**
- TUCK your tailbone under (posterior pelvic tilt)
- Squeeze the glute on the stretching side
- Keep torso upright (don't lean forward)
- Front shin should be vertical
- Breathe slowly and deeply

**Don't:**
- Arch your lower back (defeats the purpose)
- Lean forward (reduces stretch)
- Force depth before you're ready
- Hold breath
- Bounce or pulse

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Arching lower back | Tuck tailbone under, squeeze glute |
| Leaning forward | Stay upright, chest proud |
| Front knee past toes | Step front foot further out |
| Not feeling stretch | Tuck tailbone more, squeeze glute harder |
| Knee pain (back knee) | Use thicker pad under knee |

## Why the Pelvic Tilt Matters

The couch stretch only works if you maintain a posterior pelvic tilt (tailbone tucked).

**Without the tilt:** Your pelvis stays in anterior tilt, and you just hang on your hip capsule without actually stretching the hip flexors.

**With the tilt:** The pelvis rotates back, putting the hip flexors on STRETCH. This is where the magic happens.

**The cue:** "Imagine pulling your belt buckle up toward your chin."

## Programming Notes

**Frequency:** Daily (or at least 5x per week)
**When:** Morning, after sitting, or post-workout
**Duration:** 60-120 seconds per side, 2-3 rounds
**Timeline:** Expect 4-8 weeks of consistent work before noticeable improvement

**Pairing:** Works well before or after hip flexor strength work (hip flexor raises)
